CONTAINERS:

- **Lightweight**, **standalone**, **portable** and **executable software packages** that include everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the code, runtime, libraries, dependencies and system tools.
- They ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
- Application and its dependencies are packaged as a single unit called container and deployed on container platform. It makes them reusable.
- Multiple packages can be deployed on a container platform and all of them use the same OS and same hardware. Unlike VM which has a guest OS.
- Microservices built using different technologies, different frameworks can be packaged as separate containers and those multiple containers can be deployed on single container platform.

CONTAINER VS VM:

Infrastructure/Hardware/Server => Hypervisor => Host OS => Virtual Machines [Application, Dependencies, Guest OS]

Infrastructure/Hardware/Server => Host OS => Container Engine/Platform/Docker => Containers [Application, Dependencies]

- Virtualization:

**Key Difference Between Containers & VMs**

| Feature        | Containers (Docker)     | Virtual Machines (VMs)    |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Kernel         | Uses host's kernel      | Has its own kernel        |
| Isolation      | Process-level isolation | Full OS isolation         |
| Startup Time   | **Fast**(seconds)       | **Slow**(minutes)         |
| Resource Usage | **Lightweight**         | **Heavy (more RAM, CPU)** |
| Runs on        | **Host OS directly**    | **Hypervisor**            |

Docker **containers do NOT run on a hypervisor** . Instead, they **share the host OS kernel** but run in isolated user spaces.

- **Containers use the host OS kernel** (they do NOT emulate one).
- **They do not run a full OS** , only the necessary system libraries.
- **They do not run on a hypervisor** , unlike virtual machines.

This makes them **lightweight, fast, and efficient** compared to VMs.

DOCKER:

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It uses containerization to enable developers to package applications with all their dependencies into a single container, ensuring consistency across multiple development, testing, and production environments.

Docker CLI and API: Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) and API provide the means to interact with Docker from the terminal and programmatically. They allow users to manage images, containers, networks, volumes, and more through commands and HTTP requests.

Storage Drivers: Storage drivers enable Docker to store and manage data in container layers. Different storage drivers (like overlay2, aufs, and btrfs) are used based on the underlying operating system and specific use cases.

What problem it solves?

- Some application which runs on a particular machine does not run on another machine sometimes.
- This may happen due to different various reasons such as different OS, environment variables, different configurations etc.
- Dependency version conflicts, collaboration required between developer team and operations team

The two main ways to interact with Docker are:

1. Docker CLI (`docker` command in terminal)
2. Docker API (via REST calls or tools like Docker Desktop, VS Code extension, etc.)

Other tools & their roles:

- Docker Desktop → GUI-based interaction (but still uses CLI/API).
- VS Code Extension → Simplifies container management inside VS Code.
- crictl → Manages Kubernetes CRI containers , not standard Docker.
- Telnet/SSH → Used for remote access but not a direct Docker interaction method.

DOCKER CONTAINER:

- Most basic unit of docker.
- Contains layers of images => Base image (Linux Alpine), Application image and all other dependency images.

Docker Container Commands:

1. docker ps: list all running containers
2. docker ps -a: list running and stopped containers
3. docker run `image_name`: start an image - docker pull + docker start. Create and start a new container from an image.
4. docker start `containerID`: start stopped container
5. docker start `container1ID` `container2ID` `container3ID` : start multiple containers
6. docker stop `containerID`: stop a container
7. docker stop `container1ID` `container2ID` `container3ID` : stop multiple containers
8. docker restart `containerID or containerName`: Restart one or more containers
9. docker kill `containerID or containerName`: Kill one or more running containers

18. docker update container_name --memory=1g: Update configuration of one or more containers.
19. docker logs `containerID or containerName`: Fetch the logs of a container.
20. docker exec -it `containerID` /bin/bash: Run a command in a running container. interactive terminat (-it) for a docker container

Docker Run Command examples:

1. docker run -d -p 6001:6379 --name redis-new redis:4.0

- `-d`: Run in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 6001:6379`: Map port 6379 inside the container to port 6001 on the host machine.
- `--name redis-new`: Name the container "redis-new".
- `redis:4.0`: Use the Redis image, specifically version 4.0.

2. docker run -p 27017:27017 -d
   -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
   -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
   --name mongo
   --net mongo-network

- `-p 27017:27017`: Map port 27017 inside the container to port 27017 on the host machine (default MongoDB port).
- `-d`: Run the container in detached mode.
- `-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin`: Set the environment variable `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` to "admin" (initial root username for MongoDB).
- `-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password`: Set the environment variable `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` to "password" (initial root password for MongoDB).
- `--name mongo`: Name the container "mongo".
- `--net mongo-network`: Connect the container to a user-defined network named `mongo-network`. This ensures the MongoDB container can communicate with other containers on the same network.

Docker System Commands:

1. docker system df: Show docker disk usage.
2. docker system prune: Remove unused data.
3. docker system events: Get real-time events from the server.

5. docker system inspect: Display detailed information about one or more objects.
6. docker version: Show Docker version information.
7. docker info: Display system-wide information.

---

DOCKER IMAGE:

- Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. They include the application code, libraries, and dependencies. Images can be built from a Dockerfile, which is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to create the image.
- Docker image vs Docker container: Image is just the artifact. Container is the runtime environment for image.

Docker Image Commands:

1. docker images: check existing images in registry
2. docker pull `image_name`: Pull an image from a registry
3. docker push `image_name`: Push an image to a registry
4. docker build -t `image_name`: Build an image from a Dockerfile

9. docker history `image_name`: Show the history of an image
10. docker import `tarball_name`: Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image

---

DOCKER FILE:

- Text file with a set of instructions to build our own Docker image. Blueprint of the docker image.
- Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image.
- Dockerfiles enable automation of the image creation process, making it easy to reproduce and share container configurations.
- Dockerfile is always called 'Dockerfile.txt'.
- The image must be rebuilt when dockerfile is updated.

  Commands:

  **1. COPY** – Copies files from the host to the container. => COPY source destination => Example: COPY app/ /usr/src/app/
  **2. WORKDIR** – Sets the working directory inside the container => WORKDIR /app
  **3*.* ENTRYPOINT** – Defines the main executable for the container => ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "arg1", "arg2"] => Example: ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
  **4. FROM** – Specifies the base image => FROM ubuntu:latest

---

REGISTRY:

- A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images.
- Docker hub: Default public registry. Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service where Docker users can store and share their container images. It provides a centralized resource for finding and distributing containerized applications.
- Private registries/repository can also be set up for secure and controlled distribution of images within an organization.

---

PORTS:

Container port vs host port:

port mapping: -p a:b => host port:container port

---

NETWORK:

---

DOCKER VOLUMES:

- Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow data to be stored outside of the container’s filesystem, ensuring that data isn’t lost when containers are stopped or deleted.
- 3 types: Host volume, Anonymous volume, Named volumes

Docker Volume Commands:

1. docker volume create: Create a new volume.
2. docker volume ls: List all volumes.
3. docker volume inspect: Display detailed information about a volume.
4. docker volume rm: Remove one or more volumes.
5. docker volume prune: Remove all unused local volumes.

---

NETWORKING & SECURITY:

- Security: Docker incorporates several security features to ensure the integrity of containers and images. These include image signing, content trust, and various runtime security features to isolate containers and manage permissions.
- Docker network: Create an isolated network within host so that containers in that network don't require port numbers and IP address to communicate with each other, just name.

Docker Network Commands:

1. docker network ls
2. docker network create [network-name]: create a docker network

---

DOCKER COMPOSE:

- Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- Used for running multiple services. Eg: n-Tier application - like UI tier, Webservice tier and database tier
- Configuration for application's services is written in a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file.
- Filename must be: docker-compose.yaml
- It includes configuration for application’s services, networks, and volumes, simplifying the management of complex applications with multiple interconnected containers.

Docker Compose Commands:

1. docker-compose up: Create and start containers. => build image + create container + start app
2. docker compose -f mongo.yaml up: Starts all containers specified in mongo.yaml file.
3. docker-compose down: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes. => stop + delete + remove
4. docker compose -f mongo.yaml down: Stops and removes all containers specified in mongo.yaml file and the docker networks.
5. docker-compose build: Build or rebuild services.
6. docker-compose start: Start existing containers for a service.
7. docker-compose stop: Stop running containers without removing them.
8. docker-compose restart: Restart running containers.
9. docker-compose ps: List containers.
10. docker-compose exec: Execute a command in a running container.
11. docker-compose logs: View output from containers.
12. docker-compose pull: Pull service images.
13. docker-compose push: Push service images.
14. docker-compose scale: Set the number of containers for a service (deprecated in favor of `up --scale`).
15. docker-compose config: Validate and view the Compose file.
16. docker-compose rm: Remove stopped containers.
17. docker-compose run: Run a one-off command.

---

CONTAINER ORCHESTRATION:

- Orchestration: Docker orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes (often used with Docker), manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications. These tools ensure that containers are scheduled, networked, and managed according to specified requirements.
- Orchestration - Making automated tasks work with each other in a sequence.
- Container orchestration - Kubernetes - Automatically handle container deployment, scaling, availability etc.
- Docker Swarm: Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, enabling the deployment and scaling of applications across multiple machines. Swarm ensures high availability and load balancing of services.

Docker Swarm Commands:

1. docker swarm init: Initialize a swarm.
2. docker swarm join: Join a swarm as a node.
3. docker swarm leave: Leave the swarm.
4. docker swarm update: Update the swarm.
5. docker node ls: List nodes in the swarm.
6. docker node inspect: Display detailed information about a node.
7. docker node update: Update a node.
8. docker node rm: Remove one or more nodes from the swarm.

- Services and Stacks: In a Docker Swarm, services define how containers behave in production, specifying details like image, replicas, and networks. A stack is a collection of services that make up an application, defined using a Compose file, allowing for more complex deployments.

Docker Service Commands:

1. docker service create: Create a new service.
2. docker service ls: List services.
3. docker service inspect: Display detailed information about a service.
4. docker service update: Update a service.
5. docker service rm: Remove one or more services.
6. docker service scale: Scale one or more services.

Docker Stack Commands:

1. docker stack deploy: Deploy a new stack or update an existing stack.
2. docker stack ls: List stacks.
3. docker stack ps: List the tasks in a stack.
4. docker stack services: List the services in a stack.
5. docker stack rm: Remove one or more stacks.

---

Package and deploy a docker app:

1. Write a Dockerfile
2. Build the Docker Image: docker build -t myapp .
3. Run Locally to Test: docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name myapp-container myapp
4. Push Image to Docker Hub (or Private Registry):
   - docker login
   - docker tag myapp mydockerhubuser/myapp:v1
   - docker push mydockerhubuser/myapp:v1
5. Deploy to a Server
   - docker pull mydockerhubuser/myapp:v1
   - docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name myapp
6. Deploy with Docker Compose (Optional)
7. Use Kubernetes for Scalable Deployment (Optional)

DOCKER ALTERNATIVES: LXC (LINUX CONTAINERS)

**Key Differences Between Docker & LXC**

| Feature              | **Docker**                                  | **LXC**                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**      | Application-level (focuses on running apps) | System-level (like lightweight VMs)                      |
| **Ease of Use**      | Simple with `Dockerfile`, CLI, and APIs     | More complex, requires manual config                     |
| **Isolation**        | Uses namespaces & cgroups                   | Similar but provides more OS-like environment            |
| **Image Management** | Uses**Docker images**(layered, reusable)    | No built-in image system                                 |
| **Networking**       | Built-in virtual networks (bridge, overlay) | Requires manual networking setup                         |
| **Use Case**         | App packaging & deployment                  | Full system containers (e.g., running multiple services) |

- **Docker** is more user-friendly, optimized for **app deployment** , and has a rich **image ecosystem**.
- **Docker does NOT natively support a GUI** since it focuses on application-level isolation. **Docker Desktop provides GUI for containers, LXC doesn’t**
- **LXC** provides a full OS-like environment, giving more **flexibility** but requiring more **manual setup**.
- **LXC (Linux Containers) can run a GUI** because it provides a full OS-like environment.

---

**Terminology:**

- **Namespaces** : Define the resources your container can access on the host.
- **Control Groups (cgroups)** : Define how much of those resources the container can consume.
- **Port mapping:** Exposes container ports to the host system, allowing external access to services running in the container.
- **Volume mapping:** Mounts host directories or files into a container, enabling data sharing between the host and container.
