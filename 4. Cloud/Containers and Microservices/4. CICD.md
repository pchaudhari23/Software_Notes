Software Artifact:

- A software artifact is a by-product produced during the software development process. It may consist of the project source code, dependencies, binaries or resources.
- Artifacts are stored in an artifact repository.

1. Code artifact: Compiled code, setup scripts, test suites, generated objects and logs generated during testing.
2. Build artifact: Output of a build which can be an exe or tar or bin etc.
3. Project artifact: Minimum required standards, benchmarks, project vision statements, roadmaps, change logs, scope management plans and quality plans.
4. Documentation artifact: Relevant documents, including diagrams, end-user agreements, internal documentation or written guides.
