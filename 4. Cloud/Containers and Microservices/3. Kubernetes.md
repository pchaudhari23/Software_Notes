Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes helps ensure that application workloads are highly available, scalable, and efficiently managed across diverse environments.

CORE CONCEPTS:

1. Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster. Each pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.
2. Nodes: Nodes are the physical or virtual machines that make up a Kubernetes cluster. Each node runs a container runtime (like Docker), along with the Kubernetes node agent (kubelet) and other necessary components.
3. Clusters: A cluster is a set of nodes that work together to run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes. It includes at least one master node for control plane activities and several worker nodes for running application workloads.
4. Services: Services provide a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of pods. They abstract the underlying pods and enable communication between components without needing to track pod IP addresses directly.
5. Deployments: Deployments manage the desired state of application workloads, ensuring the correct number of pods are running. They support rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling of applications seamlessly.
6. ConfigMaps and Secrets: ConfigMaps store configuration data, and Secrets store sensitive information like passwords. They decouple configuration and sensitive data from the container image, allowing for greater flexibility and security.
7. Namespaces: Namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams. They create isolated environments within a single Kubernetes cluster to prevent resource conflicts and organize resources efficiently.
8. Ingress: Ingress is a collection of rules that allow external access to services within a cluster. It manages traffic routing, SSL termination, and virtual hosting, facilitating the exposure of services to the outside world.
9. Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims: Persistent Volumes (PVs) provide storage resources, while Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) request specific storage properties. They decouple storage provisioning from pod lifecycle, ensuring data persistence across pod restarts.
10. StatefulSets: StatefulSets manage stateful applications, ensuring the stable, unique identity of pods. They are used for applications that require stable network identifiers and persistent storage, like databases.
11. DaemonSets: DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a specific pod runs on all (or some) nodes in a cluster. They are typically used for cluster-wide services like logging, monitoring, or networking.
12. ReplicaSets: ReplicaSets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They are primarily used by Deployments to maintain the desired state of applications.
13. Jobs: Jobs are used to run finite, one-off tasks. They ensure that a specified number of pods successfully terminate.
14. CronJobs: CronJobs schedule jobs to run at specified times, similar to cron jobs in Unix-like systems.
15. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): HPA automatically adjusts the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, or replica set based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics.
16. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): VPA automatically adjusts the resource limits and requests for containers based on usage. It helps ensure that applications have the appropriate resources allocated.
17. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): CRDs allow users to define custom resources, enabling the extension of Kubernetes' API to manage new types of objects beyond the built-in ones.
18. Network Policies: Network Policies define rules for how pods communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They provide a way to enforce security controls at the network layer.
19. Volumes: Volumes are a way for containers to access persistent storage. Different volume types are available, such as hostPath, emptyDir, and cloud-provider-specific volumes like AWS EBS and Google Persistent Disks.
20. Kubelet: Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures that containers are running in pods and communicates with the Kubernetes control plane.
21. Controller Manager: The Controller Manager runs controllers that regulate the state of the cluster. Controllers monitor the state of cluster objects and make changes to reconcile the actual state with the desired state.
22. Scheduler: The Scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability, policies, and constraints. It ensures efficient utilization of cluster resources.

What is K8s:

- Container orchestration
- Open source developed by Google
- Used in microservices

---

Main K8s Components:

1. Node: Physical server or VM
2. Pod: Abstraction of a container, smallest unit of K8. Each pod has its own IP. PODs are ephemeral.
3. Service: Permanent IP assigned to a POD. Service is used for load balancing???
4. Ingress:
5. Configmap:
6. Secret: Used to store sensitive information which POD needs to access and use.
7. Volume: Physical storage attached to the POD to store data permanently.
8. Deployments & Statefulsets

- Deployment is an abstraction of POD

---

K8s Architecture:
Master node
Worker node

---

Minikube and kubectl - Local Setup:
Minikube cluster:

- Testing on local environment
- Master and worker processes both run on one node
- Virtual box
  kubectl:
- command line tool

---

K8s YAML Configuration File:

1. Metadata
2. Specification
3. Status

- Three dash: --- is used as a file seperator to write all the configurations in same file.

---

Organizing your components with K8s Namespaces:
A K8 cluster contains 4 namespaces by default:

1. kube-system
2. kube-public
3. kube-node-lease
4. default

- kubectl create namespace [namespace-name]: Create new namespace
- kubectl get namespace

Why is namespace needed?

1. Resources are logically grouped in namespaces
2. Many teams working on same cluster/project
3. Resource sharing and development
4. Blue/Green deployments
5. Access and resource limits on namespaces

---

K8s Ingress explained:

Helm - Package Manager:

- It's also a templating engine

---

Persisting Data in K8s with Volumes:

Storage requirements:

1. Storage that doesn't depend on POD lifecycle.
2. Storage must be available on all nodes.
3. Storage needs to survive even if cluster crashes.

Types:

1. Persistent volume
2. Persistent volume claim
3. Storage class

---

Deploying Stateful Apps with StatefulSet:

K8s Services explained:

- Each POD has it's own IP, but PODs are ephemeral i.e when a POD dies and new POD is created, it gets a new IP.
- Using service, we get static IP address. We set up service infront of PODs.

  1. ClusterIP services
  2. Headless services
  3. Nodeport services
  4. Load balancing services

Kubernetes:

- Container orchestration.
- Pod - Basic operational unit in kubernetes.
- Cluster - Group of nodes. Each node can host one or more pods.
