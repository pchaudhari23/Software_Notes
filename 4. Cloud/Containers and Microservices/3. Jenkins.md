**Introduction**

- Jenkins is an **open source automation server** which is used to **automate various stages** in a **CI/CD pipeline** such as **build, test, and deploying applications** .
- It comes with a lot of customizable plugins useful for automating repetitive tasks, making processes faster.

Run Jenkins on:

- Local machine
- Container
- Cloud

General Jenkins capabilities:

- Install/uninstall/upgrade/downgrade plugins
- Global tool configuration
- Schedule build in triggers section of job

---

**Getting Started**

1. Install Jenkins – Runs locally
2. Locate initial admin password and login
3. Install suggested plugins
4. Create first admin user

---

**JOBS**

A job is a set of tasks which Jenkins can manage.

**New Item / New Job Types**

1. Freestyle project
2. Pipeline
3. Multi configuration project
4. Folder
5. Multibranch pipeline
6. Organization folder

**Job Configuration Options**

1. General
2. Source code management
3. Triggers
4. Environment
5. Build steps — Windows: _Execute Windows batch command_ , Linux/Mac/Docker: _Execute shell_
6. Post build actions — e.g., archive build artifacts

**Job Page**

1. Status
2. Changes
3. Workspace — Dedicated directory per job where build files are stored
4. Build now
5. Configure
6. Delete project
7. Rename

**Build Number Page**

1. Status
2. Changes
3. Console output
4. Edit build information
5. Delete build
6. Timings
7. Git build data

**Key Terms**

- **Artifact** : Output generated by a job
- **Build** : Process of running a job
- **Build step** : Tasks inside a job

**Parameters**

Enable via: **General → This project is parameterized**

| Parameter Type | Windows Syntax           | Linux/Mac/Docker Syntax |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| String         | %STRING_PARAMETER_NAME%  | $STRING_PARAMETER_NAME  |
| Choice         | %CHOICE_PARAMETER_NAME%  | $CHOICE_PARAMETER_NAME  |
| Boolean        | %BOOLEAN_PARAMETER_NAME% | $BOOLEAN_PARAMETER_NAME |

---

**Views & Folders**

**Views**

- Display jobs based on criteria or filters.

**Folders**

- Group jobs, views, folders.
- Good for organizing dashboard.
- To create views for jobs inside folders → use **Recurse in subfolders** .

⚠️ **Important**

- Deleting a _view_ does **NOT** delete jobs.
- Deleting a _folder_ **WILL delete jobs inside it** .

---

**PIPELINE AS CODE**

- Written in a **Jenkinsfile** .

**Example Jenkinsfile**

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(daysToKeepStr: '10', numToKeepStr: '10'))
        timeout(time: 12, unit: 'HOURS')
        timestamps()
    }
    triggers {
        cron '@midnight'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Initialize') {
            steps { echo 'Initializing..' }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps { echo 'Building..' }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps { echo 'Testing..' }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps { echo 'Deploying....' }
        }
    }
    post {
        always { echo 'This will run after all stages, regardless of success or failure' }
        success { echo 'This will run only if the pipeline is successful' }
        failure { echo 'This will run only if the pipeline fails' }
    }
}
```

**Jenkinsfile Notes**

- Scripted pipeline: pipeline as code.
- Use Groovy script for complex logic.

---

**Key Jenkins Terms**

1. **Pipeline** – Suite of plugins that support continuous delivery using Groovy-based DSL.
2. **Node** – Machines (master/agents) that run tasks.
3. **Job/Project** – Defines tasks like build/test/deploy.
4. **Build** – One execution of a job.
5. **Plugin** – Extends Jenkins functionalities.
6. **Freestyle Project** – Simple non-code based job configuration.
7. **Declarative Pipeline** – Simple structured syntax for pipelines.
8. **Scripted Pipeline** – Advanced Groovy-based pipeline scripting.
9. **Workspace** – Directory where job executes and stores files.
10. **Artifact** – Output files produced by the build.
11. **View** – Organizes jobs visually.
12. **Credential** – Securely stored secrets (username/password/token).

**Jenkins Essentials**

**1] Jenkins and DevOps**

DevOps lifecycle stages:

- Plan
- Code
- Build
- Test
- Release
- Deploy
- Operate
- Monitor

Jenkins applies to:

- Build
- Test
- Release
- Deploy

**Jenkins and Continuous Integration**

- CI focuses on build + test phases.
- Goal: detect issues early.
- Produces artifacts (container image, JAR, exe, etc.).
- Jenkins automates creating and testing artifacts.

**Jenkins and Continuous Delivery/Deployment**

- CD applies to release + deploy stages.
- Delivery → making artifact available.
- Deployment → putting it to work (manual or automated).
- Jenkins can automate deployment steps.

**6] Securing Jenkins**

**Jenkins Practical Scenario**

**Requirement:**

I have a react application. Its hosted on github. I also have a netlify and jenkins account. I want to create a pipeline such that whenever I merge something in main branch, it should trigger a build and deploy on netlify.

Note: Jenkins server is in AWS EC2.

---

**Jenkins Script Understanding STEPS**

- Change to the root user after logging in
- Add the Jenkins debian repo to the aptitude sources list
- Configure Jenkins and plugins
- Configure nginx
- Update the source lists and upgrade any out of date packages
- Install the software for the Jenkins master: openjdk-11-jdk, nginx
- Then install Jenkins
- Confirm that Jenkins and nginx are installed
- Retrieve the initial admin password
