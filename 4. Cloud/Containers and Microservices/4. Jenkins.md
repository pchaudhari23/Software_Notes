Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It is highly extensible with plugins and is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, enabling faster and more reliable software development cycles.

CORE CONCEPTS:

1. Pipeline: A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that support implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines. Pipelines are defined using a domain-specific language (DSL) called Groovy, which provides powerful features for modeling complex workflows as code.
2. Node: Nodes are machines that are part of the Jenkins environment, where work can be distributed. The main Jenkins server is called the master node, while additional machines that perform work are called agent nodes. Nodes facilitate parallel execution of tasks, enhancing scalability.
3. Job/Project: A job or project is a fundamental unit of work in Jenkins, defining tasks like building code, running tests, and deploying applications. Jobs can be triggered by various events, such as code commits, scheduled times, or manual triggers, and can be configured through the Jenkins UI or as code.
4. Build: A build represents a single execution of a job, encompassing the series of steps defined in the job configuration. Each build has a unique number and keeps a record of logs, artifacts, and results, allowing for tracking and troubleshooting the history of job executions.
5. Plugin: Plugins extend Jenkins' functionality, offering integrations with a vast array of tools and platforms. With over a thousand plugins available, Jenkins can integrate with version control systems, build tools, cloud providers, and much more, making it highly adaptable to diverse development environments.
6. Freestyle Project: A freestyle project is a simple, flexible way to configure a job in Jenkins. It allows users to specify build steps, configure triggers, and define post-build actions without needing to write code. This is ideal for straightforward automation tasks.
7. Declarative Pipeline: A declarative pipeline is a more user-friendly way to define a Jenkins pipeline using a simpler, structured syntax. It is part of the Pipeline suite of plugins and makes it easier for users to create and maintain complex build pipelines.
8. Scripted Pipeline: A scripted pipeline provides more advanced control and flexibility over the pipeline configuration, using Groovy-based syntax. It allows for dynamic and complex scripting, giving experienced users the ability to customize their pipelines extensively.
9. Workspace: The workspace is a directory on a node where Jenkins executes a job. It contains the source code, temporary files, and build artifacts during the job execution. Each job has its own workspace, which can be cleaned up or archived as needed.
10. Artifact: Artifacts are files produced by the build process, such as compiled binaries, packages, or documentation. Jenkins allows users to archive and store these artifacts for future reference, deployment, or distribution, facilitating efficient management of build outputs.
11. View: Views in Jenkins allow users to organize jobs into groups and manage them more efficiently. Views can be configured to show specific jobs based on criteria like name patterns or job status, providing a customizable way to monitor and manage projects.
12. Credential: Credentials in Jenkins are securely stored data, such as usernames, passwords, or API tokens, used for accessing external systems and services. Managing credentials securely is critical for ensuring the security and integrity of Jenkins pipelines and integrations.
