Util:
JSON => Model class => Display
Model class - Every object in json is a new class - new class is nested under main class

1. fromJSON - from json object to model class - similar to JSON.parse()
   Map<String, dynamic> (a json object - because a json object is of type map with string keys and dynamic values) => fromJSON => Model class object
2. toJSON - from model class to json object - similar to JSON.stringify()
   return type Map<String, dynamic> and no arguments
   toJSON => JSON object

- json.decode()?
- json.encode()?
