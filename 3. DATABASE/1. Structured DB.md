DATABASES:

- A database is organised collection of data, which can be stored, retrieved and modified.
- It is a software part. The database softwares are called Database Management System (DBMS).
- The data may be stored physically in any mass storage device such as flash memory or hard drive, but logically or virtually, it is stored in a database.
- A person who works with databases is called a Database Admin or Database Administrator or DBA.
- Examples: MySQL(pronounced as my-sequel), Postgre SQL, Procedural SQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database etc.
- Structured Database - SQL: Database -> Tables -> Records
- Unstructure Database - MongoDB: Database -> Collections -> Documents

SQL: Structured Query Language

- Structured data is stored and handled in database management systems called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) Eg: MySql.
- Queries are 'fired' in any RDBMS to retrive the data and the fired query 'hits' a particular table in the database.
- SQL database is a collection of tables.
- SQL can execute queries against a database. It can retrieve data from a database, insert, update, delete records in a database.
- It can create new databases, create new tables in databases, create stored procedures in database, create views in database, can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views.

TERMS:

1. Table: In RDBMS data is stored in the form of database objects called tables. A database can contain number of tables and the tables have a relation with each other in some way. Hence the name 'Relational DBMS'. A table is a collection of related data entries containing rows and columns.
2. Records/rows: Horizontal entity, individual entry that exists in a table.
3. Fields/columns: Vertical entity, data for all the records of specific field in a table.
4. Database schema: Structure of database table containing column name and its datatype. Schema is present for SQL only. NoSQL databases do not have schema.
5. Table mappings: connecting different tables - One to one, One to many, Many to many
6. Seeding the database: Populating the database with some initial dummy data to have some data to work with during development.

COMMANDS:

1. DML (Data Manipulation Language) - Select, Update, Insert, Delete (SUID)
2. DDL (Data Defination Language) - Drop, Alter, Create, Truncate (DACT)
3. DCL (Data Control Language) - Grant, Revoke (GR)
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language) - Savepoint, Rollback, Commit (SCR)

I. Commands:
mysql>show databases; - to display existing databases
mysql>create database test; - to create a new database named 'test'
mysql>use test; - to switch to the database 'test'
mysql>show tables; - to display all the tables of the current database
mysql>source C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Db\demobld.sql (don't give semicolon at the end!!!) - to load a readymade database in MySql (in this case, 'demobld')
mysql>select \* from emp; - to display the whole 'emp' table present in some database
mysql> desc emp; - describe the 'emp' table as in display it's columns and their constraints

creating new table column : ColumnName - DataType - Constraints. Eg: DeptId int NOT NULL, UNIQUE

- CRUD:
  1.Create:
- CREATE DATABASE db_name
- CREATE TABLE table_name (col_1, col_2, ...)
- INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
- INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

  2.Read:

- SELECT _ FROM table_name; (_ means wildcard character, it returns all records)
- SELECT col_1, col_2, col_3 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

  3.Update:

- UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;

  4.Delete:

- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
- DELETE FROM table_name; (deletes entire table)

II. Operators:

1. AND : Logical AND
2. OR : Logical OR

III. Aggregate functions:

1. sum(...); - returns sum of elements of the argument column.
2. avg(...); - returns average of elements of the argument column.
3. max(...); - returns maximum value of the elements of the argument column
4. min(...); - returns minimum value of the elements of the argument column.
5. count(...); - returns the count or the number of elements of the argument column.

IV. Keywords to be used:

- where......in (.... , .... , ....);
- where......not in (.... , .... , ....);
- where......or ..........;
- where......and..........;
- where......between ....and.......;
- where......between ....or .......;
- where......like.......;
- having........
- group by .....having......;
- order by .....having......;
- concat(left(.... , ....),'....',right(.... , .....), '....');

V. SET OPERATIONS IN SQL:

1. UNION
2. UNION ALL
3. INTERSECT
4. MINUS

VI. SQL CONSTRAINTS:

1. UNIQUE
2. NOT NULL
3. CHECK
4. DEFAULT
5. INDEX (As in clustering index and non clustering index)

VII. OTHER:

1. use -- for single line commment
2. use /_ ........ _/ for multiline comment
3. floor() - round figure to lower side
4. ceil() - round figure to higher side
5. curdate() - returns current date
6. getdate() - returns date and time
