- Look and feel of the software/product
- Fine tuning of the UI/ UI refinement/ Refine the UI
- Granular control
- Tweak the logic
- End to end flow
- That is some precious real estate - For space in UI design or some important area like a resume or a physical paper document
- Data points - Of a form - fields of a form
- Data set - Dummy data filled in that form for a set of users
- Code optimisation and performance improvements
- Bottleneck
- Brainstorming
- Let's ensure that the product and code quality is upto date
- Positive test scenarios/flow/Happy path, negative test scenarios/flow
- We are all set
- It makes you life easy as a developer/ This package, extension makes your life easy
- Meet the deadlines
- Revamp the UI - give it a finishing touch
- Deliverables
- Code replication
- We don't have time for experimentation/ experimenting
- We have gained good speed, good velocity
- Let's do a thorough rehearsal, before the demo
- There was a network glitch
- Fire an API/ Fire a call to the backend/ Hit the API
- Trigger an email
- Shoot/ Drop an email, loop me in (keep me in CC)
- Refresh my memory
- I just wanted to make it foolproof
- Workflow
- The product is taking good shape/ Our app is taking good shape
- Gather some inputs
- This is a bit tricky
- We are good to go
- Know how
- Play with the product/ app , play around with it
- Essentially
- Business logic - logic by which the software will work. the business requirements
- A little changes here and there/ A little improvements here and there
- Let's maintain the consistency in the UI
- Okay I am on your screen now (screen sharing on a call)
- How this will impact the project/business is that.....
- This will impact other features
- Stakeholders in a product/ softwares
- It does the computations
- This is critical
- Develepment effort required for this
- This will go out of scope, scope of testing, scope of project or scope of development
- Rollout the changes
- Something funky is happening here
- I have a hard stop at 3:15
- But when I work with the business people, They are 'speaking a completely different language'. They are talking about sales and supply chain and logistics etc. which I don't understand
- lets commit a stable code. Ensure that the code is stable before commiting
- Usecase - We have such a usecase
- And add more colours to it....
- Is there a smart way of doing this?
- Let's make sure while fixing something, we are not breaking something else
- This is a quick fix
- You see what I did there!!!!!!!
- Tonda vr padne infront of client
- Half baked code
- Cosmetic changes
- Bug leakage
- QA Signoff
- Be careful with the wording when talking to client
- QA will catch this!!
- I will release it to QA
- Functional issues, UI issues
- Patches maarne padenge!!!! - Jugaad, Dirty solution
- This is the problem statement
- We have a dependency on - Dependency on another person or on something which can cause delay in deliverables
- Action items
- Wanted to highlight this ....
- Do the heavylifting
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- We have a blocker. Blocker - Something due to which you get stopped and cannot work furthur.
- Will work on it paralelly.
- Give the RCA (Root Cause Analysis) for this
- Reopen the bug....
- This is not a showstopper
- Intermittent issue
- My code will be overwritten by his code.
- Keep this issue under observation.
- Need to investigate/ research more on this
- Bug - The affected area in the feature
- Are you on the call?/Are you on the line?
- No code changes are required for this task.
- Expedite the development
- Spaghetti code
- This is an iterative process
- Refactor the code
- Micromanage - We'll have to micromanage this a little.
- let's have proper error handling
- The reason why this confusion happened is
- Track the status of this/ track the issue..
- Live data - Data in production
- Legacy codebase - A project repository which uses old versions, older outdated syntax, just the maintainence work is done now. It can be refactored with new version and syntax.
- Known issues
- Edge case
- I have somethings to discuss around that (around that point or topic)
- Though - Though redux toolkit reduces the boilerplate we have to write, still....
- We have a few changes lined up...
- Blanket condition..
- It might be an overkill for us...
- Data corruption in db
