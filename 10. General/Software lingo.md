1. Meet the deadlines
1. Revamp the UI - give it a finishing touch
1. Deliverables
1. Code replication
1. We don't have time for experimentation/ experimenting
1. We have gained good speed, good velocity
1. Let's do a thorough rehearsal, before the demo
1. There was a network glitch
1. Fire an API/ Fire a call to the backend/ Hit the API

1. This will impact other features
1. Stakeholders in a product/ softwares
1. It does the computations
1. This is critical
1. Develepment effort required for this
1. This will go out of scope, scope of testing, scope of project or scope of development
1. Rollout the changes
1. Something funky is happening here
1. I have a hard stop at 3:15
1. But when I work with the business people, They are 'speaking a completely different language'. They are talking about sales and supply chain and logistics etc. which I don't understand
1. lets commit a stable code. Ensure that the code is stable before commiting
1. Usecase - We have such a usecase
1. And add more colours to it....
1. Is there a smart way of doing this?
1. Let's make sure while fixing something, we are not breaking something else
1. This is a quick fix
1. You see what I did there!!!!!!!
1. Tonda vr padne infront of client
1. Half baked code
1. Cosmetic changes
1. Bug leakage
1. QA Signoff
1. Be careful with the wording when talking to client
1. QA will catch this!!
1. I will release it to QA
1. Functional issues, UI issues
1. Patches maarne padenge!!!! - Jugaad, Dirty solution
1. This is the problem statement
1. We have a dependency on - Dependency on another person or on something which can cause delay in deliverables
1. Action items
1. Wanted to highlight this ....
1. Do the heavylifting
1. Steps to reproduce the bug
1. We have a blocker. Blocker - Something due to which you get stopped and cannot work furthur.
1. Will work on it paralelly.
1. Give the RCA (Root Cause Analysis) for this
1. Reopen the bug....
1. This is not a showstopper
1. Intermittent issue
1. My code will be overwritten by his code.
1. Keep this issue under observation.
1. Need to investigate/ research more on this
1. Bug - The affected area in the feature
1. Are you on the call?/Are you on the line?
1. No code changes are required for this task.
1. Expedite the development
1. Spaghetti code
1. This is an iterative process
1. Refactor the code
1. Micromanage - We'll have to micromanage this a little.
1. let's have proper error handling
1. The reason why this confusion happened is
1. Track the status of this/ track the issue..
1. Live data - Data in production
1. Legacy codebase - A project repository which uses old versions, older outdated syntax, just the maintainence work is done now. It can be refactored with new version and syntax.
1. Known issues
1. Edge case
1. I have somethings to discuss around that (around that point or topic)
1. Though - Though redux toolkit reduces the boilerplate we have to write, still....
