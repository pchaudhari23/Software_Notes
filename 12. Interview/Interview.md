INTRODUCTION:

Sure!! My name is Pritam Chaudhari. Currently I am working as a software engineer as a developer at Nitor. I joined here as a fresher back in 2019, so I have around 4.5 years of experience by now. In this span I got a chance to work on multiple projects from different domains. In initial 1 year I was into mobile app development using flutter and react native.
Post that I worked on multiple react projects. So frontend development is my primary skill. The most recent project was the Bluestar CSR portal which is a scholarship portal - purely web app built in react. [React 16.8.6]
I have worked on implementing react apps using typescript as well as pure javascript apps. As for my responsibility, I was mainly involved in developing react functional components as per requirements for CRUD operations. The I have used state management solutions like redux, redux toolkit and redux saga. Then for API communication I have used Axios library, for UI development used Material UI library, then routing using react-router library, authentication and authorisation, form validation, unit testing, building and deploying react applications. All such different functionalities I have implemented.
I also have knowledge about react hooks, extensions like eslint, prettier to ensuring coding standards. Then tools like POSTMAN for API testing, swagger, git, JIRA, VS code.
In terms of non technical responsibilities in my previous projects I had to interact daily with the client, discuss the solutions, giving demo.
So yeah. This is all about my experience till now and I am looking for more challenging work in frontend where dynamic standalone component development is involved.

Work:
So Nitor is my first company. I joined here in December 2019 through CDAC campus placements. So three years of experience upto now. And in this span I have worked on around 7 to 8 projects, most of them were in React JS. So frontend development is my primary skill. Apart from that I have also worked on technologies like React native and Flutter used for mobile application development and I have also taken training on Node JS and AWS. Full stack, MERN stack and cloud computing are my areas of interest, I am learning and exploring the/ Right now I am learning Tauri it's a framework for building cross platform desktop applications. Currently I am working on two projects - Shadowbox which is in the healthcare domain and BIRA91 and here my contribution is mainly from JavaScript side.

- During initial years of career,
- I am focusing on that right now.
- That is priority.
- To me....
- Understanding how softwares are developed
- And later I would like to have take lead and managerial role.
- Absolutely! And even though I am a technical person. I have always believed that it is essential to have a fair amount of business sense or management sense.
- Whatever feedback or criticism I receive from my managers or senior developers, leads, I learn from that.
- Indeed we still have a long way to go
- But for now it's party time
- Abhi to mujhe aap sabse bahot kuch seekhna hai....

- Diversify skill set. Knowledge of multiple domains but specialize in one skill.
- 1. Web development, 2. App development
- Separate the concepts from technologies. Learn the concepts. Master any one technology of every concept.
- Open source contribution. I want to do this!!!
- Heard about a new technology or a new library. Picking up that new technology. Knowing where and how to use it. How I can use it to improve my projects.
