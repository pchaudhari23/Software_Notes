Data Structures: It is a format of storing and organizing data in order to access or modify it efficiently.
Need of data structures:

- Data structures are formed and stored in main memory (RAM) at runtime, when program is being executed.
- We structure the data and develope algorithms to access or modify them quickly and efficiently.
- We also structure the data to reduce the memory requirements of the program.

---

Algorithms:

- An algorithm is a sequence of actions which are taken to solve a problem.
- Depending on a particular problem, a particular data structure is choosen and an algorithm is applied on that data structure to solve the problem.

---

Data structures vs Database:

- Data structure reside in primary memory at program runtime. They are temperory.
- Database exisits in secondary memory and is permanent.

Types of data structures:
1.Linear and non-linear
2.Homogeneous and non homogeneous

- Linear data structures: Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked list
