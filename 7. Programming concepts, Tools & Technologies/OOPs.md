OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS:

1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation & data hiding
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Inheritance
7. Dynamic binding
8. Message passing

9. CLASS:

- Class is a collection of similar objects.
- It is a blueprint for an object. Like a floor plan is to a building.
- Class is an extension of C structures.
- The main difference between C structures and class is that, structure contains only variables called structure members whereas class contains both.
  variables (data members) and functions (member functions).
- The data members and member functions can be private or public or protected.
- Memory allocation does not happen on creation of class.

2. OBJECT:

- An object is anything which has some attributes, certain behavior or properties is an object.
- An object is the instance of class.
- An object is a variable of type class.
- Memory is allocated or reserved on creation of objects.

3. ENCAPSULATION:

- Binding the data members of the object with its member functions.

4. ABSTRACTION:

- Knowing only necessary data. Not knowing the behavior of the object.

5. POLYMORPHISM:

- The term ‘polymorphism’ comes from a combination of Greek words, ‘Poly’ meaning many and ‘Morph’ meaning form. Hence polymorphism means the ability to gain
  many forms.
- Many forms for same thing. Different behavior for different caller.

6. OVERLOADING:

- Assigning more than one meaning to a function or a symbol is called overloading.
- There are two types of overloading: Operator overloading and function overloading.

7. FUNCTION OR METHOD OVERLOADING:
8. METHOD OVERRIDING:
9. OPERATOR OVERLOADING:

10. INHERITANCE:
    10.1 : ASSOCIATION
    10.2 : COMPOSITION
    10.3 : AGGREGATION

11. COUPLING:

- It is the measure of dependency between two functions.
- It must be low.

12. COHESION:

- It is the measure of dependency between two statements within a module or a function.
- It must be high.
- A good code has low coupling and high cohesion.
- It promotes code reusability.

13. CONSTRUCTOR:
14. DESTRUCTOR:
