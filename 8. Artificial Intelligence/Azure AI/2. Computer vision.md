FUNDAMENTALS:
Image:

- A multidimensional array of pixels.
- Every pixel has a value between 0(black) and 255(white) - Grayscale
- Colored images - 3 multidimensional arrays - channels. Red, green and blue.
- The result is calculated by values of RGB - at each pixel.
- Image filter: Filter kernel is convolved over the image. Convolutional filtering.
- ML algo for image: convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Label is the output of the network.
- Bounding box coordinate: co-ordinates of all four corners of the square in which the content lies.
- Microsoft Florence model - Image processing model.

Azure AI Vision
Azure AI services

Azure AI Vision supports multiple image analysis capabilities, including:

1. Optical character recognition (OCR) - extracting text from images.
2. Generating captions and descriptions of images.
3. Detection of thousands of common objects in images.
4. Tagging visual features in images.

Custom models:

1. Image classification
2. Object detection

Every detected object has:

1. Confidence score
2. Bounding box coordinates

FACE:
Resource - Azure AI Face

Single service: Face
Multi service: Face API

Azure AI Vision service - Face service:

1. Face detection - Bounding box coordinates for a face in image.
2. Face attribute analysis
3. Facial landmark location
4. Face comparison
5. Facial recognition
6. Facial liveness

- To compare and match the faces - A GUID is assigned to each face.
- Use responsible ai principles for face services. Approval required through Limited access policy.

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION:
Resources:
Azure AI Custom Vision

- Build own computer vision model.
- Two resources required - 1.Training resource, 2.Prediction resource
- Feature -> Model -> Label

Image classification:

1. Multiclass classification: Image belongs to one label
2. Multilabel classification: Image belongs to multiple labels

- You can publish a trained Azure AI Custom Vision model to either an Azure AI Custom Vision (Prediction) resource or an Azure AI Services resource.

Azure Custom computer vision: Image classification & Object detection

1. Submit data
2. Define labels
3. Train
4. Test, retrain, use

---

OBJECT DETECTION: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/detect-objects-images/

- Detect the presence and location of objects in image.
- Object detection models - Upload and label images on Azure AI Custom vision portal.
- Tag the images
- Bounding box co-ordinates: left, top, width, height. Top left corner of bounding box and width and height of box.

Image classification with custom Azure AI Vision models :
Resource: Azure AI Services resource/ Azure AI Vision resource

Custom models:

1. Image classification - Multiclass, Multilabel
2. Object detection - Class label + Location in image
3. Product recognition

Custom model:

1. Dataset - training images (Stored in a blob container)
2. COCO file - labels for the dataset - JSON file - has 3 things - images, annotations, categories. Create a project in Azure ML Data labelling project - it gives the coco file for given images
3. Open the Labelling project in Azure ML studio
4. Label the images
5. Train the model

COCO file:Common Objects in Context

- JSON representation - Labels and meta data
- Used in computer vision for image segmentation, classification, object detection
- Contains the labels for the images used for training purpose.
- Labelling the training data - Azure Machine Learning studio - Data Labeling Project

VIDEO:
Resource - Azure AI Video Indexer

1. Facial recognition
2. Optical character recognition
3. Speech transcription
4. Topics
5. Sentiment
6. Labels
7. Content moderation
8. Scene segmentation

Using video indexer service into custom applications:

1. Azure Video Indexer widgets
2. Azure Video Indexer API

- Train the custom model in indexer to recognize - people, language, brands.
- Video: https://api.videoindexer.ai/Auth/<location>/Accounts/<accountId>/AccessToken - get token and use it to.
