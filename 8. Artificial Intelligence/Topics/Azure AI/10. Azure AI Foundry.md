**Azure AI Foundry => Prompt Flow** is a development framework for defining flows that orchestrate interactions with an LLM.

AI Content Understanding:

- Extract insights and data from multiple kind of content.
- Use multi-modal model to consume different format of content.
- Define schema for information to be extracted.

Information extraction solutions:

1. Content understanding
2. Document intelligence
3. Knowledge mining

Types of ML Models:

1. Chat completion model
2. Reasoning model
3. Image generation model
4. Multi modal model
5. Embeddings model - RAG

Embeddings - multidimensional vectors of a token

Vector search

Vector database

RAG uses two models:

1. Embeddings model (retrieve)
2. LLM (generation)

AI Agents:

- Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
- AI Agents perform sequence of complex tasks on our behalf, without needing human intervention.
- AI Agents can use different tools. Custom tools can be integrated.
- Semantic kernel SDK => Semantic kernel Agent Framework => AzureAIAgent
- AzureAIAgent, Chat completion agent, OpenAI Assistant Agent
