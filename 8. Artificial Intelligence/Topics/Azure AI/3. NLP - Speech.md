FUNDAMENTALS: Resources - Azure AI Speech, Azure AI Speech SDK

TEXT TO SPEECH: Speech synthesis - the ability to generate spoken output

1. Text to speech API
2. Batch synthesis API

- Can specify speech synthesis voices
- Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
- SpeechSynthesizer object
- SpeechConfig: Location & key
- AudioConfig: Output device such as speaker or file in which output must be written
- SpeechConfig + AudioConfig => Speech synthesizer => SpeakTextAsync() => SpeechSynthesisResult object

SPEECH TO TEXT: Speech recognition - the ability to detect and interpret spoken input

1. Real-time transcription
2. Batch transcription - Speech to text API - Microsoft-owned and deployed to Microsoft Azure: Universal Language Model
3. Speech to text Short Audio API: short speech upto 60 sec
4. Fast transcription
5. Custom speech

- SpeechRecognizer Object - SpeechConfig & AudioConfig - Speech API - Call the API and process the response
- SpeechConfig: Location & key
- AudioConfig: Input such as microphone or file which must be input
- SpeechConfig + AudioConfig => Speech Recognizer => RecognizeOnceAsync() => SpeechRecognitionResult object
- Speaker Recognition: Recognize individual speakers based on their voice.
- Intent Recognition: Conversational language understanding to determine the semantic meaning of spoken input

1. Acoustic model - Audio signal to phonemes + Language model - phonemes mapped to words.
2. Words converted to text

Analyse text and process speech

- Key phrase extraction
- Entity recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Language detection
