FUNDAMENTALS:

- Resources are created in an Azure subscription.
- Resource group: Collection of Azure resources. Resources are created within a resource group.

Resource has:

1. Endpoint URI: REST API endpoint for a resource.
2. Subscription key: Identifier for a resource.
3. Resource location

Types:

1. Multi service resource: Same key and endpoint for all resources.
2. Single service resource: Unique key and endpoint per resource. Created to see the costs seperately.

- Free tier is only supported for single service resources.

Authentication:

- Resource key. Resource management - Keys and Endpoint.
- Key and endpoint are required in authentication header while using REST API.

Resources are accessed using:

1. REST API
2. SDK:Python, C#, JavaScript
3. Portal - Studio interfaces

Steps:

1. Create a resource on Azure portal - Note key, endpoint and location. Also a storage account is required to store a sample/training data - in blob or container.
2. If required, create a project in the Azure studio and add the created resource to that project.
3. Use REST API or SDK to use that resource.

Resource creation requirements:

- Subscription
- Resource group
- Unique name
- Location
- Pricing tier

- Review, create and deploy resource

DEVELOPMENT:

- Training: Feature - Input, Label - Output
- Inferencing: Predicting the label
- Confidence scores - Probability of prediction.

TRY CONSUMING A SERVICE USING REST API - PYTHON OR JAVASCRIPT
SDKs - SPECIFIC CLIENT LIBRARIES

SECURITY:
Azure Key Vault

1. Keys - Store/import key in encrypted format in HSM
2. Secrets - Store passwords, connection strings etc in plaintext format
3. Certificates - generate or store digital certificates

Access to Key vault:

1. Security principal - User identities that are authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID.
2. Manage identity - Identity assigned to a client application by security principal. It is used to access the keys stored in key vault. This eliminates the need to store keys in a file minimizing the risk.

Best Practices:

- Regenerate keys regularly, from portal or CLI.
- Two keys are given for every service. Regenerate them one by one.
- CLI command: 'az cognitiveservices account keys regenerate'
- Store keys in key vault and assign managed identity to client application to access the keys.
- Control access to key vault using RBAC.
- Token based authentication - Token valid for 10 min is obtained using the key. It must be used on every request.

- Apply network access restrictions to block unwanted users or IP.
- Use https, monitor usage for any unusual activity

Microsoft Entra ID authentication -
1.Authenticate using service principals: - Create a custom subdomain - Assign a role to a service principal
2.Authenticate using managed identities: - System-assigned managed identity - User-assigned managed identity

Azure Private Link - access Azure services using a private endpoint.
Private endpoint - An endpoint to access Private link. A connection is made between private endpoint and load balancer.

Creating private link:
1.Create a virtual network - Create a resource, give name and select region, set encryption or security rules - Set IP address range
2.Create load balancer - Create frontend IP configuration - Create virtual machine and add it to the backend pool - Inbound and outbound rules
3.Create a private link services
4.Create a private endpoint

Azure Virtual network and Azure firewall
In networking tab of a resource: Select allow access or private endpoint
Security - Network access + Keys

---

MONITORING:

- Create alert rules
- View metrics on metrics page
- Diagnostic logging - Azure log analytics, Azure storage
- Create diagnostic settings: Azure Log Analytics, Azure Storage
- Monitoring: 1.Performance monitoring, 2.Health monitoring, 3.Security monitoring
- Monitor costs - Estimate on pricing calculator page

---

DEPLOYMENT:

1. Docker server.
2. Azure Container Instance (ACI).
3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

- Following things are required to deploy Azure AI services container image to a host:

1. ApiKey
2. Billing
3. EULA - Accept value

- Subscription key is not required for client applications which consume AI Services from container????
- Container images stored in a container registry. Eg: Docker Hub, Microsoft Container Registry, ECR.

Deployment considerations:

1. Scalability
2. Platform compatibility
3. Security and privacy
4. Versioning and updates
5. Multilingual support
6. Continuous improvement

---

Content safety:

1. Create content safety resource
2. Create project in content safety studio and use the created resource for that project

Text moderation - 0 to 6
Severity: Safe (0), low(2), medium(4), high(6)
Categories: Hate, Violence, Sexual, Self harm

- More threshold - harsh content can pass, less threshhold - it will be blocked

How to consume custom models in application?

- Create resource and create project in studio
- In the project, assign the resource
- Create a new model in the studio portal
- Train it, evaluate, deploy and test
- In client app - 4 things required - Endpoint, key, model id, deployment name

Storage account - Blob, container, table, queue. Mostly it contains the sample training data for ML Model.

Custom models:

1. Custom computer vision model - image classification & object detection
2. Custom text classification
3. Custom named entity recognition
4. Custom skill in Azure search
5. Custom document intelligence model
