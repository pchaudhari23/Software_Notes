ACCESSIBILITY: a11y

- Design and development of digital products for people with physical disability and visual/audio/sensory impairments.
- Users need to install screen reader software in their device. The screen reader speaks what content is shown on screen. In mobile, there is a setting for accessibility. Helpful for blind people.
- Press Ctrl + Win + Enter to start Narrator. - SCREEN READER FOR A11Y

Physical disabilities:

1. Blind – Screen reader
2. Low vision – Screen magnifier
3. Color blindness – Text labels/pattern for colored content
4. Hearing impairment – Captions, subtitles, transcripts, visual cues (like alert, notification, warning)
5. Motor disability/Cognitive disability – Assistive technologies – Keyboard navigation, joystick, large touch area, simple and clear instructions, simple navigation etc.
6. Keyboard navigation – Using enter key to submit form instead of clicking on submit, using tab keys to navigate between fields.

Pointers:

1. Semantic HTML (proper use of HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, etc.)
2. ARIA Roles & Attributes (e.g., aria-label, aria-live, role="button")
3. Keyboard Navigation (focus management, keyboard events)
4. Color Contrast (sufficient contrast between text and background)
5. Form Accessibility (proper labels, inputs, error messages)
6. Screen Reader Support (accessible descriptions for elements)
7. Accessible Images (use of alt text for images)
8. Focus Management (managing focus for dynamic content like modals)
9. Accessible Navigation (skip navigation, proper tab order)
10. Multimedia Accessibility (captions, transcripts for videos)
11. Responsive Design (adjustable layouts for various devices and assistive technologies)
12. Error Handling & Notifications (announcing errors to screen readers)
13. Custom Components Accessibility (e.g., custom buttons, sliders)
14. Testing with Accessibility Tools (e.g., React-axe, Lighthouse)
15. Localization for Accessibility (support for RTL languages, localized screen reader support)
16. Accessible Charts & Graphs (providing data in an accessible way)
17. Time Limit Management (providing options for users with time constraints)
18. User Preferences (support for larger text, color contrast modes)
