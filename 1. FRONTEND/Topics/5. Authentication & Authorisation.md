AUTHENTICATION:

- Verifying the user credentials. Is the username and password combination correct. Should the user be allowed to login.
- OAuth2, SSO, Okta
- Cognito
- Microsoft azure AD

---

AUTHORISATION:

- Determine which parts of the app the user can access based on his/her role (user/admin) i.e to authorise the user/ is the user authorised to access this part of product?
- What actions the user can perform after login in
- Roles are stored in (JWT) token
- Hence token is sent while making API response
- Access to the product parts are given based upon the role of the user.
- For that the token is passed in the api call. The token contains the role.
- Suppose there is a software application which has some premium features which is paid. Some users will buy it, some will not buy it. Based on the user type we must determine if the user is 'authorised' to use this feature of application.
- RBAC: Role Based Access Control: Some parts of software must be accessible to admin only other parts must be accessible to employees only .... something like that.

Why do we need authentication and authorisation?

- To protect our APIs
- To control the access which user gets to the app
- What is refresh token and auth token?
- What are cookies?
