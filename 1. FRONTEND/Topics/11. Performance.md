WHEN USER VISITS A WEBSITE:

1. End user: Clicks on link or enters the website name in browser URL bar. DNS resolution is done to find out the server IP and HTTP connection is made.
2. Browser request: Send request to web server.
3. Server response: Single HTML file (index.html) is returned. Contains minimal code - 1. div containing id="root", 2. script tag which loads the react javascript bundle - main.js, 3. link tag to load the css which is optional.
4. Browser parsing and download: HTML is parsed in the browser. At the same time, Javascript and CSS bundles and static assets like images, CSS, fonts, icons, json files etc. are downloaded. These files come from the same build folder generated during the build process.
5. Javascript parsing and execution: React and react DOM are initialized. Components imported and Code like `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)` runs. Downloaded static assets are loaded as and when required.
6. React bootstrap: The app creates the virtual DOM and renders the root component into the actual DOM.
7. State initialization, data fetching, routing and dynamic component rendering begin

CSR: Client Side Rendering

- Good for SPAs
- Bad for SEO because the page does not have content as content is loaded in the browser after the user visits the website.

---

SSR: Server Side Rendering

- HTML is built on the server and sent to client. Hydration happens at the client.

---

SSG: Static Site Generation

- HTML is built on the server and sent to client. Hydration happens at the client.
- HTML file for every single page of the website is built during build process. Hence very long build process, but very fast on client.
- Useful for CMS, blogs, documentation, marketing websites where content does not change often and hence frequent builds are not required.

ISR: Incremental Static Regeneration [SSR + SSG]

- HTML is built on the server and sent to client. Hydration happens at the client.
-

---

STATIC WEBSITE:

- HTML, CSS, JS
- Web page may not necessarily be static. The page content might change by DOM updates.
- But the source code is same. The files used in website are same.

---

DYNAMIC WEBSITE:

- Web servers support server side scripting languages - Active Server Pages (ASP), Javascript (Node JS), PHP, Python, and Ruby.
- Web page is created in the server and then delivered to client. Server side rendering.
- Users see different content every time they use the application. Eg: YouTube

---

Lazy Loading:

- Don't load the complete assets of the webpage such as images beforehand, just load the necessary data required to display the page.
- Load the static assets when it is required. Be "lazy" while loading the page, do only what is necessary.
- Lazy loading is also used in caching. The data is filled in cache only when it is required avoiding unnecessary filling of data that is not requested.
