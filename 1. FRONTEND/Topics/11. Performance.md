WHEN USER VISITS A WEBSITE:

1. End user: Clicks on link or enters the website name in browser URL bar. DNS resolution is done to find out the server IP and HTTP connection is made.
2. Browser request: Send request to web server.
3. Server response: Single HTML file (index.html) is returned. Contains minimal code - 1. div containing id="root", 2. script tag which loads the react javascript bundle - main.js, 3. link tag to load the css which is optional.
4. Browser parsing and download: HTML is parsed in the browser. At the same time, Javascript and CSS bundles and static assets like images, CSS, fonts, icons, json files etc. are downloaded. These files come from the same build folder generated during the build process.
5. Javascript parsing and execution: React and react DOM are initialized. Components imported and Code like `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)` runs. Downloaded static assets are loaded as and when required.
6. React bootstrap: The app creates the virtual DOM and renders the root component into the actual DOM.
7. State initialization, data fetching, routing and dynamic component rendering begin

CSR: Client Side Rendering

- Good for SPAs
- Bad for SEO because the page does not have content as content is loaded in the browser after the user visits the website.

---

SSR: Server Side Rendering

- HTML is built on the server and sent to client. Hydration happens at the client.

---

SSG: Static Site Generation

- HTML is built on the server and sent to client. Hydration happens at the client.
- HTML file for every single page of the website is built during build process. Hence very long build process, but very fast on client.
- Useful for CMS, blogs, documentation, marketing websites where content does not change often and hence frequent builds are not required.
