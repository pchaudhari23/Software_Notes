WHEN USER VISITS A WEBSITE:

1. End user: Clicks on link or enters the website name in browser URL bar. DNS resolution is done to find out the server IP and HTTP connection is made.
2. Browser request: Send request to web server.
3. Server response: Single HTML file (index.html) is returned. Contains minimal code - 1. div containing id="root", 2. script tag which loads the react javascript bundle - main.js, 3. link tag to load the css which is optional.
4. Browser parsing and download: HTML is parsed in the browser. At the same time, Javascript and CSS bundles and static assets like images, CSS, fonts, icons, json files etc. are downloaded. These files come from the same build folder generated during the build process.
5. Javascript parsing and execution: React and react DOM are initialized. Components imported and Code like `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)` runs. Downloaded static assets are loaded as and when required.
6. React bootstrap: The app creates the virtual DOM and renders the root component into the actual DOM.
7. State initialization, data fetching, routing and dynamic component rendering begin
