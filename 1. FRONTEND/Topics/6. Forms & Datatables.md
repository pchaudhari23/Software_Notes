FORMS:

- Form: dirty - the moment you interact with a form, focus in a field/fill a value/click a button etc. you call it as dirty.
- Reset the form after it is submitted.
- What if fields depends on each other. Field B and C depends on what user enters or selects in field A. So we can either hide or disable field B and C.
