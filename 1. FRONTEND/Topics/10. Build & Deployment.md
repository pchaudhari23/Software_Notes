STEPS POST DEVELOPMENT:

1. Linting: Enforce consistent code style, catch syntax and logic errors. Tool - ESLint
2. Formatting: Automatically format code for consistency. Tool - Prettier
3. Transpile: Used to convert modern javascript code into backward compatible javascript for old browsers.Transform + Compile. Tool - Babel. File for Babel configuration: .babelrc or babel.config.js
4. Bundling: Combine multiple JS files/modules into a single or few bundles for efficient loading. Tool - Webpack. File for webpack configuration: webpack.config.js
5. Optimization:
   - Minification: Reduce file size by removing whitespace, comments, and shortening variable names. Tool - Terser
   - Tree Shaking: Remove unused code from bundles.
   - Code splitting: Splitting large bundle of javascript code into smaller chunks which are loaded on demand. Eg: import syntax, lazy and suspense.
   - Dead code removal: Remove unreachable code segments.
   - Asset optimization: Optimize images, fonts, and other static assets.
   - Caching & hashing: Add content hashes to filenames for long-term caching.
6. Building: Output final production-ready files into a folder, typically named `build/` or `dist/`
7. Deployment: Deploy on a server. Static hosting, traditional server, cloud platform, container.

BUILD TOOLS:

BUILD FOLDER:

1. index.html
2. static folder => javascript files, CSS files, asset files. The filenames in this are hashed and the files are minified.
3. asst-manifest.json
4. favicon.ico
5. manifest.json
