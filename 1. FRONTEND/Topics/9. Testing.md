- Unit testing: Should not connect to db, use mock data
- Entity: Business object. It's what we see in UI, what we send through API and store in DB. Entities are related to each other. Hence ER diagrams. Eg: Social media app: Post, Comment, User etc., Ecommerce app: Product, Cart, Orders, User etc.
- Monorepo vs microservices

Add cucumber extension in vs code

Cucumber tests contain two different files: the feature file and the step definition file. The feature file contains the scenarios in Gherkin format that are Given, When, and then format, and the Step Definition file contains the actual code or implementation of test cases.

Feature: What feature the file is testing
Background: Runs before every scenario
Scenario: Given, Then, And, When

---

Steps:
Then('.....', async function(){
...
await...
.....
})

PO - page objects: Called inside steps function
Class Modal {
