CSR or SSR:

- SSR - Rendering page before sending to client. Default SSR. For CSR - add "use client" at the top.
- Routing: React - React router DOM, Next JS - File based routing system. Each folder in app directory is route.
- Nested route - Folder within folder
- Dynamic route - Folder name with square brackets

Full stack applications: API routes - route.js

Data fetching

- SSR
- SSG - Static Site Generation
- ISG - Incremental Static Generation
