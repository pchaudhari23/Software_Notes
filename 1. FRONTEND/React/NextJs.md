FEATURES:

1. Server side rendering: Default SSR. For CSR - add "use client" at the top. By moving rendering and data fetching to the server, you can reduce the amount of code sent to the client, which can improve your application's performance.
2. File based routing system. So we can create folder structure as per the routes we want. It also supports nested routing and dynamic routing. Each folder in app directory is route. Nested route - Folder within folder, Dynamic route - Folder name with square brackets. API routes - route.js
3. Typescript support
4. Image optimization
5. It allows us to create API routes
6. Automatic code splitting
7. Static site generation
8. Incremental static regeneration
9. SEO - Metatdata - Static metadata & Dynamic metadata

SSR (Server Side Rendering): getServerSideProps

SSG (Static Site Generation): getStaticProps
