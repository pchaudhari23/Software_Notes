NEXT JS: It is a react framework for building full stack web applications.

FEATURES:

1. Server side rendering
2. File based routing system. So we can create folder structure as per the routes we want. It also supports nested routing and dynamic routing.
3. Typescript support
4. Image optimization
5. It allows us to create API routes
6. Automatic code splitting
7. Static site generation
8. Incremental static regeneration

CSR or SSR:

- SSR - Rendering page before sending to client. Default SSR. For CSR - add "use client" at the top.
- Routing: React - React router DOM, Next JS - File based routing system. Each folder in app directory is route.
- Nested route - Folder within folder
- Dynamic route - Folder name with square brackets

Hydration: Adding interactivity to the page. Attaching event listeners and internal state to HTML is rendered from server in SSR.

Full stack applications: API routes - route.js

Data fetching

- SSR
- SSG - Static Site Generation
- ISG - Incremental Static Generation
- By moving rendering and data fetching to the server, you can reduce the amount of code sent to the client, which can improve your application's performance.
- Automatic code splitting

API routes - Express JS is required.
Create API folder in app directory - route.js file

SEO:

- Metatdata - Static metadata & Dynamic metadata
- TailwindCSS - Similar to bootstrap
- Authentication - next-auth/react, nextAuth.js
- Server Actions
