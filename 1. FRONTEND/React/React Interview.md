DEMO CODE: Interviewer shows a code snippet and asks

1. Identify and fix errors in the code
2. Tell output of this snippet
3. Understand the program and explain what it does from end user perspective
4. Finish/optimize the given code

- Interviewer wants to check your approach. He wants to know how you solve the problem.
- He wants to check whether you understand the question or not. Make sure that you understand the question and acknowledge
- He will not ask direct questions but ask twisted questions. Dont jump into code directly. Ask first to interviewer. Interact with him.
- Sometimes he does not expect the entire working component. You can write pseudocode. If you don't remember syntax.
