- EULA - End User Licence Agreement: Terms and conditions needed to accept while installing the software. Tick the checkbox - I agree.

- Ask for feedback and star rating withing the app instead of appstore or playstore. "Enjoying `<appname>`??"

On registration, that data must be collected for some analytics purpose...God knows how it is used. Why the hell? Every app is going to consume some space, some compute power.
- Find some solution for this... Most restaurants use this method. They don't have menu card... they have a QR at the table. When we scan it, it opens a website containing menu OR it opens a whatsapp chat which is a Q&A bot.
- Anti piracy - Microsoft is aware that wiindows and office versions are used as crack or pirated versions in many systems across the world. Can they do anything about it? Same thing with torrent movies and software download
