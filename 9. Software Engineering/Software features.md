- Mobile applications: Nobody wants to install one million apps on their smartphone. Just an app to order something, then an app for another small thing. Then sign up, then sign in.... On registration, that data must be collected for some analytics purpose...God knows how it is used. Why the hell? Every app is going to consume some space, some compute power.
