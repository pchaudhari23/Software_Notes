SELF LEARNING:

Daily: 1 or 2 hrs - 9 to 12 PM
Other: 1 hr

1. Learning - new things
2. Core skills - Debugging, problem solving, critical, analytical thinking, being useful in a project

- Some days when we have less work, no work or work is finished faster - First thing!!! Don't inform your manager!!!!
- It's one thing to learn new technology, some udemy course, youtube, blog, chatGPT or building hobby project. But its completely different to contribute to ongoing production app or a project.
- Learning, having knowledge is one thing and being able to contribute to a project is different.
- Explore the GitHub repo of any product or library. To know how company or open source technology works technically.
- Upgrading dependencies/libraries during ongoing project? Usually we don't upgrade to latest versions immediately, we wait for it to become stable?
- Developers and testers must understand business requirements first. That is the source of knowledge for both. If both are on the same page only then the project can happen otherwise there will be miscommunication and conflicts between devs and QA.

Thoughts:

1. Learn many things with decent knowledge but one thing with deep knowledge. Jack of all trades, master of one. Scale up and scale out.
2. Is learning new things worth investing time, effort and money? What return does it give me in terms of salary?
3. Or should I spend time honing and sharpening my known skills? Which of two is better use of time?

WORK PROJECT PERFORMANCE:

Before starting any work:

- Clear understanding of requirements
- Asking any doubts, queries, questions to UX or required person
- Getting test plan from QA
- Giving proper estimates for work
- Create subtasks immidiately under the story - What is the scope of this story? What are the things I need to implement as a part of this story?
- Set weekly target: No. of stories / No. of weeks in sprint

During development:

- Debugging

After development:

- Debugging
- Testing
- Refactoring
- Doing peer review

Defect:

- Fix issue
- Give to QA

HIGHER MANAGEMENT:

- All activities are tracked — including commits, pull requests (PRs), and the timestamps for opening, closing, and updating JIRA tickets.
- How tracking works: The JIRA ticket number must be included in the commit message. This links the commit to the corresponding PR, and within the JIRA ticket’s side panel (under the Development section), you can view the related branches and commits.
- At the end of each sprint, reports are generated and audits are conducted. If any discrepancies or gaps are identified, questions and justifications may be requested.

- Debugging
- Refactoring
- Testing
