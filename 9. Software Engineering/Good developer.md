DEBUGGING SKILLS:

Basic debugging:

- Breakpoints, debugger, console.log()
- Trace the flow, how data is passed between functions
- Search for keywords: current file, entire project
- Trial and error: Isolate the issue
- Reproduce the error
- Minimize timewaste - focus on quickly reproducing the bug/defect/error

Knowledge:

- Search effectively: Learn to quickly google errors and find relevant solutions
- Learning things quickly
- Gain a strong understanding of the codebase: know how to explore and navigate a project repository.
- Understand fundamental programming concepts, including data structures, loops, conditionals, and built-in methods.

Thinking:

- Debugging comes with practice
- Debugging in mind: mentally trace and reason through your code before or during debugging
- If its taking time, ask for help or work with team mates, because we have deadlines
- Think calmly. Break the problem into smaller tasks. Think in steps. What I want? What steps I need to take to reach there?
- Shifting the gears???

Testing:

- Testing the code regularly throughout the development process.
- Ensure that new fixes or features do not introduce regression issues (i.e., breaking existing functionality).
- Validate edge cases to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Implementing complex or connected tasks or lot of scenarios - Make a list of scenarios/combinations or a matrix

Error handling:

- Learn how to identify and monitor component re-renders in React (e.g., using console.log() or React Developer Tools).
- Understand and troubleshoot common JavaScript errors such as “cannot read property of undefined”, type errors, and reference errors.
- Effective error handling techniques: null checks, optional chaining (?.), and default fallbacks (|| [], || {}).
- List of the most frequent JavaScript and React errors to recognize and handle them gracefully.

Code quality:

- Follow best coding practices and write optimized, efficient code that minimizes unnecessary loops and complex conditions.
- Improve coding productivity through effective workflows, tools, and habits.
- Refactoring the code from time to time to maintain clarity, performance, and scalability.

Misc:

- Rebuild/restart project, clear the cache, hard refresh in browser
- API Error: Before going to API team, check the API request body and endpoint URL, query and path parameters.
- Environment Error: Something working on dev but not on prod? Check the environment variables, compare the code, compare the logs, find out the difference between them.

SELF LEARNING:

Daily: 1 or 2 hrs - 9 to 12 PM
Other: 1 hr

1. Learning - new things
2. Core skills - Debugging, problem solving, critical, analytical thinking, being useful in a project

- Some days when we have less work, no work or work is finished faster - First thing!!! Don't inform your manager!!!!
- It's one thing to learn new technology, some udemy course, youtube, blog, chatGPT or building hobby project. But its completely different to contribute to ongoing production app or a project.
- Learning, having knowledge is one thing and being able to contribute to a project is different.
- Explore the GitHub repo of any product or library. To know how company or open source technology works technically.
- Upgrading dependencies/libraries during ongoing project? Usually we don't upgrade to latest versions immediately, we wait for it to become stable?
- Developers and testers must understand business requirements first. That is the source of knowledge for both. If both are on the same page only then the project can happen otherwise there will be miscommunication and conflicts between devs and QA.

PRODUCTIVITY EXPECTATIONS:

Working day: 8 hrs.
Productivity: 5 hrs.

Three stages:

1. Morning - before meeting - 9 to 10 AM - 1hr
2. Afternoon - post lunch - 2 to 5 PM - 2hrs
3. Evening - post tea break - 5 to 8 PM - 2hrs

Expectations:

- Quick understanding
- Good logic and analysis
- Good conceptual knowledge
- Good project knowledge
- Spend half to one hour daily to understand repo
- Speed
- Complexity of task and the skill level or experience. More tasks completed in less time.
- Learning new things, exploring for the project work
- Be confident in your development
- Shift your gears
- Projects process and compliance

---

WORK PROJECT PERFORMANCE:

Before starting any work:

- Clear understanding of requirements
- Asking any doubts, queries, questions to UX or required person
- Getting test plan from QA
- Giving proper estimates for work
- Create subtasks immidiately under the story - What is the scope of this story? What are the things I need to implement as a part of this story?
- Set weekly target: No. of stories / No. of weeks in sprint

During development:

- Debugging

After development:

- Debugging
- Testing
- Refactoring
- Doing peer review

Defect:

- Fix issue
- Give to QA

HIGHER MANAGEMENT:

- All activities are tracked — including commits, pull requests (PRs), and the timestamps for opening, closing, and updating JIRA tickets.
- How tracking works: The JIRA ticket number must be included in the commit message. This links the commit to the corresponding PR, and within the JIRA ticket’s side panel (under the Development section), you can view the related branches and commits.
- At the end of each sprint, reports are generated and audits are conducted. If any discrepancies or gaps are identified, questions and justifications may be requested.

WORK QUALITY:

- Debugging
- Refactoring
- Testing

WORK & TIME MANAGEMENT:

- Work
- Learning
- Other (Project, practice, preparation etc) - Can plan on only weekends or holidays as well

SIDE TASKS: Non Coding work

PAIN POINTS/CHALLENGES:

- Unable to estimate properly - major point !!!
- Side tasks consume time
- Feeling sleepy, lazy, lethargic
- Unable to pay attention in meetings
- Too much work apart from coding Jira board
- Too many meetings
- Too many Side tasks
- Getting foggy unable to understand sometimes
- Not clear communication sometimes
- In between tasks take time
- JIRA board activities are time consuming and frustrating
- It feels like complete chaos and confusion
- Juggling and multitasking
- Asking basic questions
- SIDE TASKS: Major point
- Sometimes I just feel stuck...not able to think forward
- Some people get it immidiately and why couldn't I think of that

---

SOFT SKILLS:

- Good english
- Skillful communication
  - Highlight blockers, dependencies in time
  - Getting the context. What that person has to say.

---

MIND SKILLS:

- Focus
- Grasping
