Debugging skills:

1. Debugging comes with practice
2. console.log()
3. debugger, breakpoints
4. search for keywords in file, project
5. trial and error
6. rebuild/restart project
7. minimize timepass / time waste - when debugging to reproduce the bug/defect/error
8. reproduce the error
9. If its taking time, ask for help or work with team mates, because we have deadlines
10. Think calmly. Break the problem into smaller tasks. Think in steps. What I want? What steps I need to take to reach there?
11. Check the edge cases
12. Fixing one thing should not break another
13. Trace the flow, how data is passed between functions
14. how to check if a component is getting re rendered in react? console.log('in function...')
15. common errors - cannot read of undefined etc...
16. learn error handling, null check, optional chaining, || [], || {} etc. how to handle errors gracefully
17. get a list of most common/frequent javascript and react errors from chatGPT
18. Before going to API team, check the API request body and endpoint URL.
19. Something working on dev but not in prod - check the environment variables, compare the code, compare the logs, find out the difference between them
20. learn to google error and find something quickly
21. learning things quickly
22. Good understanding of the codebase. How to explore and understand a project repository?
23. Understand the basic concepts, data structures, loops, conditions, built-in methods
24. Implementing complex or connected tasks or lot of scenarios - Make a list of scenarios/combinations or a matrix
25. What are some coding best practices and code refactoring
26. what are some good ways to write optimized code, to avoid loops, complex conditions etc...
27. debug in your mind???
28. shifting the gears???
29. How to increase coding productivity???

- Two parts:

1. Learning - new things
2. Core skills - Debugging, problem solving, critical, analytical thinking, being useful in a project
   It's one thing to learn new technology, some udemy course, youtube, blog, chatGPT or building hobby project. But its completely different to contribute to ongoing production app or a project.

- Improve the debugging
- Be confident in your development
- Shift your gears
- Sometimes I just feel stuck...not able to think forward
- Some people get it immidiately and why couldn't I think of that
- Projects process and compliance
- Soft skills

1. Development and debugging
2. Communication
3. Understanding the requirements
