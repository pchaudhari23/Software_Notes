AGILE: Long tasks(epic) broken into smaller tasks (stories) put into two week development cycles (sprints). https://www.atlassian.com/agile

User story:

- User story => Story points => Fibonacci numbers
- For larger stories => split the ticket into two fibonnaci numbers
- Split a user story: 3 sub tasks - UI implementation, API integration, Testing
- Add acceptance criteria, title should be in format - As a end user I should be ablt to....

JIRA:

- UX Handoff: Given by design team. Post that UI and API implementation is started.
- After the handoff - Add stories in backlog. On new sprint, pull the backlog items.
- Be liberal in assigning story points, considering buffer time
- Update the JIRA board on daily basis, checkin the code regularly.
- Close the story on JIRA after the PR is merged in main branch

Task lifecycle:

1. Ticket assigned to dev on JIRA
2. Analyse the task, prepare estimate and timeline if big task or change request
3. Create Timelines/ Estimates for the task: Sr. no., Task, Total Man Days, Start date, End date, Status. Keep some buffer time in between, any schedule or plan must be flexible enough. Release if early completed.
4. Do testing
5. Code reviewed and MR merged by team lead
