POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:

---

STORY:

- B2B product for secure file transfer across different organizations.

---

UNDERSTANDING:

Entities/Modules:

1. Organizations - Default org, my org, my partner org, partner org, org unit - My Organization - Partner Organizations - Organization units - nested - follows hierarchy
2. Users
3. FEC
4. Endpoints
5. Communities
6. Routing channels
7. Routing channel templates
8. SSH Keys - KUK, UIK, AUK
9. SSH Remote profiles

Workflow:

---

- Default organisation => Company => Business unit.
- Company cannot be created under company.
- Business unit can be created under another business unit.
- Company and business units can be edited but not deleted.
  fg_sysadmin - default organisation

Producer (sends file) => File Gateway => Consumer (receives file)

sfg-ui => packages => shell

Shell:

- Hooks/methods - PageUtil, useApplicationInfo, usePage
- Page
- PageHeader
- PageBody
- PageActions
- DataTable

CDS:

- Form
- Fields - Combobox, Textinput, Toggle, RadioButtonGroup

TECH STACK:
1.Frontend: React
2.Backend: JAVA
3.DB: Oracle
4.Liberty server
5.Identity server

**INTERNATIONALIZATION (i18n), LOCALIZATION (l10n):**

---

**ACCESSIBILITY (a11y):** Playwright + Axe core

- **@axe-core/platwright** package is used to integrate axe core accessibility testing engine directly with playwright automated tests.
- As a result we can run automated accessibility check across different browsers while running end to end testing workflow.
- Then we need **axe-html-reporter** for generating HTML report of violations & passes.

---

**HOCs, App:**

Snippets:

```javascript
const { page } = Shell.usePage(
[],
(function Page(pageArgs, pageUtil) {
  return {
    model: { ... },
    form: { ... },
    datasources: { ... },
    observers: [ ... ],
    ui:{...}
    init: function () { ... },
    customFunction: function () { ... }
  };
})(pageArgs, pageUtil)
);

const pageConfig = {}
```

usePage:

- This is a custom hook. It contains an IIFE (Immidiately invoked function expression). Returns a page object. The form, model objects can be used from page.

JSX:
Shell.Page
Shell.PageHeader => title, description
Shell.PageBody => CDS.Form => Grid
Shell.PageActions

**REACT FORMS:**

**BDD:**

- **Behaviour Driven Development**: Software development approach where we **define and test the expected behaviour** of application using **simple, natural language** that all stakeholders can understand.
- The **end to end test scenarios** are written in **feature files**. Uses Cucumber and playwright together.
- **Playwright**: A **Modern end-to-end testing framework** developed by **Microsoft** for **automating web browsers** and **testing web applications**.
- Playwright supports **cross-browser testing** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and **parallel test execution**.
- **Cucumber**: A **BDD testing framework** that allows users to write test scenarios in plain, human-readable language.
- Cucumber uses **Gherkin language** which has **Given-When-Then syntax** so that non technical stakeholders can understand the test scenarions.
- Scenarios have **step definitions** which map to actual test code in any given language such as Java, JavaScript or Python etc.
- Steps written in Cucumber are **executed through the step definitions**, and **those step definitions call Playwright code** to automate the browser.

**MONOREPO:**

The project uses **Turborepo as its build system**, integrated with **Yarn workspaces** to manage a monorepo structure. The turbo.json configuration file is located exclusively in the b2bi-shared repository.

**Repository Structure**

- **b2bi-ui-shared** => packages => build-lib, shell, shell-components, styles, ui-lib and utils
- **gatewayui** => sfg-ui

**Yarn Workspaces Configuration**: Yarn workspace: All packages live in same repo & managed by Yarn. Root package.json defines workspace locations.

**Standard Package Structure**

1. **src/index.js** : Central entry point that aggregates and re-exports all module files
2. **package.json** : Defines src/index.js as the main entry point
3. **turbo.json** : Build configuration for Turborepo
4. **webpack.config.js** : Webpack bundling configuration

---

**SHELL:**

---

**CRACO:**

- craco config contains package aliases - Connecting b2bi-shared to sfg repo
- babel.config.js: file used for javascript compiler babel so that modern javascript can be used on current/old browsers
