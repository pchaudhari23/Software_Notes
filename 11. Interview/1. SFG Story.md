**INTERNATIONALIZATION (i18n), LOCALIZATION (l10n):**

Process:

1. We wrote english text for all UI in locale files.
2. Then we did pseudo localization testing to check if every text is covered in localization.
3. Then the english text was given to the translation team where they gave the corresponding translations for all supported languages.
4. Then QA did localization testing to check if there are any issues on UI when using other languages.
5. Then we fixed those issues or asked the translation team to fix it.

- We add i18n configuration file in a project and wrap the application with `<I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}></I18nextProvider>`
- In configuration we use different plugins like Browser Language Detector to identify language from browser settings. HttpBackend used to load the JSON translation files.
- react-i18next is used to integrate i18next with react. Its used to initialize i18n in application by providing fallback language, namespace, backend load path where the translation files are stored.
- We get useTranslation hook from react-i18next which gives: 1. t function: It returns the translation for given key and also accepts dynamic values in parameters. 2. i18n: i18n.changeLanguage(lang) is used to change the language based on user selection.

**ACCESSIBILITY (a11y):** Playwright + Axe core

- **@axe-core/platwright** package is used to integrate axe core accessibility testing engine directly with playwright automated tests.
- As a result we can run automated accessibility check across different browsers while running end to end testing workflow.
- Then we need **axe-html-reporter** for generating HTML report of violations & passes.

**HOCs, App:**

Snippets:

```javascript
const { page } = Shell.usePage(
[],
(function Page(pageArgs, pageUtil) {
  return {
    model: { ... },
    form: { ... },
    datasources: { ... },
    observers: [ ... ],
    ui:{...}
    init: function () { ... },
    customFunction: function () { ... }
  };
})(pageArgs, pageUtil)
);

const pageConfig = {}
```

usePage:

- This is a custom hook. It contains an IIFE (Immidiately invoked function expression). Returns a page object. The form, model objects can be used from page.

JSX:
Shell.Page
Shell.PageHeader => title, description
Shell.PageBody => CDS.Form => Grid
Shell.PageActions

---

**AUTHENTICATION:**

- OIDC
- What is identity server?
- What is liberty server?

---

**ROUTING:**

---

**CDS + REACT HOOK FORMS:**

1. useFormContext()
2. useController()
3. useForm(), FormProvider
4. FormUtils
5. PropTypes & default props

---

**REACT CONTEXT + CUSTOM PROVIDER:**

1. createContext()
2. useContext()
3. ApplicationProvider, AuthProvider, DataServiceProvider, ModalProvider, PageProvider etc. - No global state, multiple domain based, scoped stores.

Typical Provider:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const SomeContext = createContext(null);

export function SomeProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);
  const setValue = (value) => {
    setState(value);
  };
  const resetValue = () => {
    setState(null);
  };

  return (
    <SomeContext.Provider value={{ state, setValue, resetValue }}>
      {children}
    </SomeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// consumer hook
export function useSome() {
  const context = useContext(SomeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useSome must be in SomeProvider");
  }
  return Context;
}

// Usage
<SomeContext>
  <App />
</SomeContext>;

const { state, setValue, resetState } = useSome();
```

**BDD:**

- **Behaviour Driven Development**: Software development approach where we **define and test the expected behaviour** of application using **simple, natural language** that all stakeholders can understand.
- The **end to end test scenarios** are written in **feature files**. Uses Cucumber and playwright together.
- **Playwright**: A **Modern end-to-end testing framework** developed by **Microsoft** for **automating web browsers** and **testing web applications**.
- Playwright supports **cross-browser testing** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and **parallel test execution**.
- **Cucumber**: A **BDD testing framework** that allows users to write test scenarios in plain, human-readable language.
- Cucumber uses **Gherkin language** which has **Given-When-Then syntax** so that non technical stakeholders can understand the test scenarions.
- Scenarios have **step definitions** which map to actual test code in any given language such as Java, JavaScript or Python etc.
- Steps written in Cucumber are **executed through the step definitions**, and **those step definitions call Playwright code** to automate the browser.

**MONOREPO:**

The project uses **Turborepo as its build system**, integrated with **Yarn workspaces** to manage a monorepo structure. The turbo.json configuration file is located exclusively in the b2bi-shared repository.

**Repository Structure**

- **b2bi-ui-shared** => packages => build-lib, shell, shell-components, styles, ui-lib and utils
- **gatewayui** => sfg-ui

**Yarn Workspaces Configuration**: Yarn workspace: All packages live in same repo & managed by Yarn. Root package.json defines workspace locations.

**Standard Package Structure**

1. **src/index.js** : Central entry point that aggregates and re-exports all module files
2. **package.json** : Defines src/index.js as the main entry point
3. **turbo.json** : Build configuration for Turborepo
4. **webpack.config.js** : Webpack bundling configuration

- create-react-library vs create-react-app??
- rollup.js => JavaScript module bundler

---

**SHELL:**

---

**CRACO:**

- craco config contains package aliases - Connecting b2bi-shared to sfg repo
- babel.config.js: file used for javascript compiler babel so that modern javascript can be used on current/old browsers
