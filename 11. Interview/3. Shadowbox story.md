RESUME MENTION:

* Overview: Desktop application in healthcare domain. Used to integrate EHR with
  different diagnostic Labs and LIS systems for placing the lab test order of patients.
* Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HIPPA training
* Responsibilities:
  1. Lab requisition form development and testing, patient HL7 data mapping.
  2. Implement functionality using Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
  3. Implement REST API using Node.js and Express to consume in frontend app.
  4. Write queries to store, retrieve, and modify patient data in Mongo DB for labs.
  5. Discuss solutions and blockers in daily stand-up meetings with the US client.

LEARNINGS:

---

Flow:

1. Get the patient data from EHR in HL7 format using API.
2. The data is mapped to the form and list of tests is shown.
3. On submitting the form, the data is saved in db.

Shadowbox:

- This is actually a startup in US healthcare and their primary use case was...
- Every form has static and dynamic part.
- Static part has...
- Dynamic part has...
- EJS has this syntax like <%= .... %> where in we can write javascript code

---

- Orders were stored in a SFTP server
- Few labs use hl7 and few used apis
- Consider adding MVC in the resume and view would be the forms of labs
- Have the form generated from chatgpt. Just give it fields and description
- Patient data can be fetched from ehr or lis as well?
- Every lab will have its own db instance where it stores orders and lab results
- All data transferred in HL7 format. How to add node express mongo in this story?
- Some labs are api based. Like PLS, Careviso, Ovation labs - study them specially and thoroughly to create a story.

1. Data is pulled from EHR
2. Tests are selected and order is placed
3. Lab results are available

User portal and user related activity such as placing orders using node apis

- Entities in DB:

1. Patients
2. Lab orders - Of patients
3. Lab results - of patients

SHB:
1.Security
2.Authentication and authoraisation:
3.Form validation for lab requisition
4.What is an auth server?

1.An API call is made to EHR to fetch HL7 data of the patient.
2.The HL7 is parsed using a parser.
3.The patient details are populated on the form and rendered to the browser.
4.The user chooses the test and submits form.
5.The form data is collected in backend.

- Production deployments are done by DevOps member.
- DevOps person co-ordinates with the developer of the feature to push the code changes from dev branch to production branch.

---

Steps:
1.Take pull of the repo in a folder and switch to dev branch.
2.Take pull of same repo in another folder and switch to UAT branch.
3.Open the two folders in WinMerge tool to compare them.
4.Confirm with the developer about the code changes made in dev branch and the push the code changes in UAT branch.
5.Raise a merge request to merge UAT branch into prod branch.
6.Once approved UAT is merged into prod branch. UAT and prod branches are always in sync.

---

WinMerge:

- Used to compare the same folder/ repo but two different branches.
- Left panel contains code from dev branch.
- Right panel contains code from UAT branch.
- Compare a particular file. If the code changes made by the developer are regarding the ticket being deployed, shift the snippet from left to right.
- Sometimes both files are made completely identical i.e. whole file is shifted from left to right.
- Sometimes small snippets are shifted. Sometimes new files are added.
- Then commit and push on the UAT branch. And raise merge request.

---

1. Deploy on NitorAWS - code pushed on develop branch
2. Deploy on UAT - code pushed on UAT branch
3. Deploy on production - code pushed on prod branch

---

Task end to end process:

- Ticket assigned to dev on JIRA
- Analyse the task, prepare estimate and timeline if big task or change request
- Do unit testing
- Code reviewed and MR merged by team lead

Dev => Unit testing => Deployment Dev server => QA => UAT on Dev server => Deployment on UAT branch => Deployment on Production branch => QA on production => UAT on production => QC on production => Assign to CS team to verify with the client

Dev => QA => QC => CS Team => Client

Coding practices:
Cross Teams work:
Client interaction:
Processes:
Manager:
Business Analyst:
DevOps:
Deployment:
QA Team and QA Lead: QA round OR QA iteration
Dev team: Technical Lead, Architect
CS team:Client/Customer success
TWINTIP TEAM: Cross Teams work

Defend yourself in front of Manager, QA, Client
Handle the conflicts with QA. This is not a bug but expected behaviour. This is invalid bug.

1.Sr. no.

3.Total Man Days
4.Start date
5.End
6.Status

- Keep some buffer time in between, any schedule or plan must be flexible enough. Release if early completed.
