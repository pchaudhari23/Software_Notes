NODE:

- Javascript **runtime environment** which runs on **Google** **chrome's V8 javascript engine**.
- Executes **outside** the browser.
- **Single threaded**: It executes one main thread sequentially so the code runs line by line.
- **Event loop:** Async tasks are handled by the **event loop** , so the main thread never blocks.
- Has **Non blocking I/O**: Uses **libuv** library to perform I/O operations.
- **Worker threads:** For CPU-heavy tasks, Node.js supports **worker threads** to run JavaScript in **parallel** from a thread pool.
- **Event driven**: Supports **asynchronous code** execution - Uses promises, callbacks and async/await.
- Has **built in modules** for various functionalities - like file handling, encryption, data fetching etc.
- Modules are written in JavaScript & C++ language
- Cross platform, Rich ecosystem, Scalable, real time applications
- Free, open-source
- Current version: v24.x (Dec 2025)

EXPRESS:

- Fast, lightweight, minimalist framework
- Buidiling **web applications** and **APIs** with Node js
- Supports **middlewares** to intercept and process requests and responses - express.json() for JSON and express.static() for serving static files
- Supports **routing**
- Supports templating engines
- RESTful API Development
- Static file serving
- Unopinionated - so we don't have to follow a fixed project structure
- Current version: v5.x (Dec 2025)

Mongo DB:

- MongoDB is a **distributed, document-oriented NoSQL** database storing data in **JSON-like documents**.
- **It i**nternally stores data in **Binary JSON (BSON)** , a binary-encoded format that is faster to parse and supports more data types than JSON.
- It uses a **flexible, schema-less design** so that we can use dynamic data structures. Although we can put **schema validation** using **Mongoose**.
- **High availability** - achieved through replica sets that provide automatic failover and redundancy.
- **Horizontal scaling** - done using sharding to distribute data across multiple servers for large workloads.
- **Aggregation pipeline** - a powerful framework to transform, filter, and analyze data in stages.
- **ACID transactions** - supported since MongoDB 4.0 for multi-document operations, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
- **Rich indexing** - supports text, geospatial, compound, and other indexes for faster query performance.
- Current version: v7.x (Dec 2025)

JAVASCRIPT:

Javascript engines: Executes JavaScript programs. Chrome - V8, Firefox - SpiderMonkey, Apple Safari - JavaScriptCore/Nitro, Microsoft Edge - Chakra

How it works:

1. Parsing: Source code parsed and converted into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
2. Interpretation / Bytecode Generation: The AST is used to generate **bytecode** (an intermediate representation). Some engines interpret this bytecode directly.
3. Compilation (JIT): Frequently executed code is optimized and **compiled into machine code** using **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation. This improves performance.
4. Execution: Event loop decides what is executed and when.

EVENT LOOP:

Components:

- Call Stack – Where function calls are executed.
- Web APIs (not part of JS engine but present in browsers) – Handlers for async operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.
- Callback / Task Queue (a.k.a. Message Queue) – Where callbacks from Web APIs go.
- Microtask Queue – For promises (`.then`, `catch`, etc.) – runs before the callback queue.

Execution:

1. JavaScript executes code in the **call stack**. Synchronous code runs here first.
2. When async functions (e.g., `setTimeout`) are called, they're handled by **Web APIs** .
3. Once done, their **callbacks** are pushed to the **callback queue** .
4. The **event loop** checks:
   - If the **call stack is empty** , it:
     1. First runs all **microtasks** (like promise handlers).
     2. Then moves one task from the **callback queue** to the call stack.
