NODE:

- Javascript **runtime environment** which runs on **chrome's V8 javascript engine**.
- Executes **outside** the browser.
- **Single threaded**: It executes the code line by line - sequentially. Uses **event loop** for execution of async operations.
- **Event driven**: Supports **asynchronous code** execution - Uses promises, callbacks and async/await.
- Has **Non blocking I/O**: Uses **libuv** library.
- Has **built in modules** for various functionalities - like file handling, encryption, api request, http etc.
- **Cross platform, Rich ecosystem, Scalable, real time applications**
- Modules are written in C++ language
- Free, open-source, cross-platform

EXPRESS:

- Fast, lightweight, minimalist framework
- Buidiling **web applications** and **APIs** with Node js
- Supports **middlewares** to intercept and process requests and responses - express.json() for JSON and express.static() for serving static files
- Supports **routing**
- Supports templating engines
- RESTful API Development
- Static file serving

JAVASCRIPT:

Javascript engines: Executes JavaScript programs. Chrome - V8, Firefox - SpiderMonkey, Apple Safari - JavaScriptCore/Nitro, Microsoft Edge - Chakra

How it works:

1. Parsing: Source code parsed and converted into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
2. Interpretation / Bytecode Generation: The AST is used to generate **bytecode** (an intermediate representation). Some engines interpret this bytecode directly.
3. Compilation (JIT): Frequently executed code is optimized and **compiled into machine code** using **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation. This improves performance.
4. Execution: Event loop decides what is executed and when.

EVENT LOOP:

Components:

- Call Stack – Where function calls are executed.
- Web APIs (not part of JS engine but present in browsers) – Handlers for async operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.
- Callback / Task Queue (a.k.a. Message Queue) – Where callbacks from Web APIs go.
- Microtask Queue – For promises (`.then`, `catch`, etc.) – runs before the callback queue.

Execution:

1. JavaScript executes code in the **call stack**. Synchronous code runs here first.
2. When async functions (e.g., `setTimeout`) are called, they're handled by **Web APIs** .
3. Once done, their **callbacks** are pushed to the **callback queue** .
4. The **event loop** checks:
   - If the **call stack is empty** , it:
     1. First runs all **microtasks** (like promise handlers).
     2. Then moves one task from the **callback queue** to the call stack.
