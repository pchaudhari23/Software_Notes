SECURE DATA/FILE TRANSFER:

- Asymmetric encryption - Uses public & private keys. Both sender and receiver each have their own public-private key pair.
- Private key is not shared with anyone. Public key can be shared.
- Once connection is established between sender and receiver, public keys are shared with each other.
- Sign (Private Key - Sender) => Encrypt (Public Key - Receiver) => Send File => Decrypt (Private Key - Receiver) => Verify (Public Key - Sender)
- Source: Sign + Encrypt, Destination: Decrypt + Verify
- Eg: PGP: Pretty Good Privacy, GPG: GNU Privacy Guard

Storage:

1. Private keys: On device, Hardware tokens
2. Public keys: Public key servers, directories, Websites, repositories, Embedded in email signatures, Direct sharing

SIGN: PRIVATE KEY - SENDER

- **Digital signing** is the process of attaching a **digital signature** to a message or file.
- Pass the data through a hash function to generate a fixed size fingerprint of the data.
- Encrypt the created hash using sender's private key. This creates a digital signature of the file.

ENCRYPT: PUBLIC KEY - RECEIVER

- Combine the plain text data and digital signature.
- Encrypt data using some algorithm and receiver's public key.

DECRYPT: PRIVATE KEY - RECEIVER

- Opposite of encryption. Convert into plain text so that the signature can be verified.

VERIFY: PUBLIC KEY - SENDER

- Opposite of signing. This step for authenticity (verify sender identity) and integrity (ensure file is not tampered)

---

Sender: Private - Signing, Public: Verification

Receiver: Private - Decrypt, Public: Encrypt

---

- Public key - **Encrypt** data or **verify** a signature
- Private key - **Decrypt** data or **create** a signature
- E.g: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is asymmetric encryption algorithm.
